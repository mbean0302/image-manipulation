# image-manipulation
image manipulation scripts for Udemy Training Course.


I am in the ZTM Python Complete Developer class on Udemy and have modified an exercise into a more easy to use (at least for me) program. It converts JPG images into PNG images, but allows you to drag and drop JPG images into a folder and then convert them. After that you have the option to delete the original files or keep them. And an explorer pops up to show the newly created converted files.

The original exercise was a console command line program initiation that took two system arguments. The original file and the new file where PNG's will be created. I didn't want to have to remember to put in the file types in a certain syntax, and wanted a more "prompted" experience.

I would like to compile all this into a clickable .exe file, but have tried py2exe as well as Pyinstaller modules and both seem to not work with v3.8. Would like some help, if anyone knows a work around for this with another module... Also, I can downgrade a venv to 3.5 to have support for py2exe, but that would be a last resort for me. 

Thanks for any help!

PS: I would like more info on how to structure my repo file structure and use a structure that most of the community adopts as "standard". Any thoughts on this would be great! Currently, to negate any confusion, the actual script file (Converter.py) is located in the "image-manipulation/image_exercises/JPG_to_PNG Converter" folder of the repo.
