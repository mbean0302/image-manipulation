This folder will be created in the root directory if not already in root.

This is the folder you will drag and drop the JPG files you wish to convert

The script will prompt you when to do so.

PS: I chose 10 high-res JPG files randomly from Unsplash.com to use for the test and all were over 5MB. The conversion process seemed to take longer than I expected it to (1s-1.5s each), but maybe it is nothing. All of the time.sleep functions are simply to give the user time to read the prompts before opening windows and such, but none should be effecting the actual conversion time... Any help speeding this up would be appreciated as well, if it is a poor module choice or something on my part...
